# Personal Responsive Profile
 
 
# Description
This is the personal profile of Krista Meiers. It was created using Bootstrap components to build a responsive portfolio of updated projects. 
 
# Homepage - Index.html
 
The first page, kristacoding.github.io introduces the reader to me, Krista Meiers, with a picture and short paragraph of my current employment, work, and fun facts. 
 
This page was created using bootstrap components in the navigation, div containers, buttons, and footers to build a responsive page for any device. Personal touches were added through with CSS such as the font pulled from Google fonts, the image border, and color theme. 
 
The footer two components from bootstrap. First, I added a <div class= "col-md-12">, with the intention of making the image responsive for all devices. Additionally, I added the bootstrap ID of 'sticky-footer' to make the footer sticky. 
 
The main focus was to build a page that would accurately represent me as a Junior Full Stack Developer and an SEO Specialist.

# Portfolio - Portfolio.html 
 
This second page was created to hold all my current projects. To show my bootstrap component and div container/row skills, I have added in placeholders to hold future projects. 
 
The first set of 'cards' were created by using the bootstrap component cards with a div row to add 4 cards in a row. Implementing images, links and button code was also used here to create a friendly user experience. 
 
The second row was created to show my understanding of div rows and columns. The first row is divided in half using <div class="col-md-6">, to make two columns 'Front end Projects' and 'Backend Projects'. Embedded in the first column code 'Front end Projects', I have added three additional columns to make separate sections for 'HTML', 'CSS' and 'Javascript' projects using <div class="col-md-4">. In the 'Backend Projects', I made two additional columns using <div class="col-md-6">. To easily show the different columns and rows, I have added a border around each section using the class 'border'.

# Contact Form - Contactme.html 
 
The contact me page was created for users to submit a form if they want to contact me for SEO, Full Stack Development, or hiking. It has sections for the user to submit basic contact information such as 'Name' and 'Email', then an area for them to select why they are reaching out. Finally, it has a message section that they can add any additional notes or comments. This section also has a prompt with suggestions. 
 
Each section was created using Bootstrap and formatted to match my desire for the form. I added the addition them touches such as the background, font, button, and button color change. 
 
My hope is to continue working on this page so when a form is submitted it comes to me in an email. Currently, there is no system set up, so the form can never truly be submitted.
